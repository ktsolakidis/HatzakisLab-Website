    text: "We are delighted to welcome Professor Konstantin Balashev from the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy at Sofia University 'St. Kliment Ohridski' and Medical University – Pleven (part-time), who is joining us as a visiting scholar this month! During his stay he will be conducting research on the molecular mechanisms by which the neurotoxin Vipoxin interacts with model membrane systems (monolayers, bilayers, vesicles) and living cells. By combining advanced single-particle and single-molecule tracking techniques, the work aims to uncover new insights into toxin - membrane interactions at the nanoscale. This visit is supported by the European initiative Sofia University Marking Momentum for Innovation and Technological Transfer (SUMMIT).",

    #SEMORE is a general analysis platform based on #machinelearning  for semiautomatic analysis and classification of #superresolution data. #SEMORE uses a multi-layered density-based clustering module to dissect biological assemblies and a morphology #fingerprinting module for quantification by multiple geometric and kinetics-based descriptors. Based on these Semore is capable of operation at densely populated clusters and also for live super resolution imaging . Being a time-aware framework it can also support the rise of 4D super-resolution data
    
    The work was performed at Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, part of ISBUC UCPH and funded by Novo Nordisk Foundation as well as VELUX FONDEN. `,

Along with Nikos, our postdoc Errika Voutyritsa, two PhD students, and two master's students joined this renowned science event. 
    
    Nikos and Errika gave engaging talks at the conference, sharing their latest research with other scientists and attendees. Their presentations sparked interesting discussions and were a great opportunity to showcase our group's work. 
    
    Our students also had their moment to shine. The PhD and master's students presented their research through posters. These presentations covered a range of biophysics topics and were a perfect chance for them to get feedback and insights from experts in the field. 
    
    But it wasn't all work! The conference was a fun experience for everyone. Our students especially enjoyed meeting other researchers and students from around the world. It was a great opportunity for them to learn new things, see different perspectives, and get inspired for their own projects. 
    
    Overall, the Biophysical Society Annual Meeting 2024 was not just a scientific event, but also a chance for growth, learning, and making great memories. We're proud of what our team has achieved and excited about the opportunities that came from attending this event. We can't wait to see what comes next in our research adventures!
    
    Stay tuned for more news from our group!`,

This center will form a bridge between my lab at Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen with the co-PIs Tom Kirchhausen at Harvard Medical School, Knud J. Jensen at Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen and Maria Carmo-Fonseca at University of Lisbon. While Oligonucleotide therapeutics are emerging as important therapeutics for pathologies such as immune, cancer, muscular and neurological diseases as well as for control of viral pathogens, their use is limited by their poor intercellular delivery: less than 5% escape endosomes. The scope of the Centre is to provide the required mechanistic understanding to optimize subcellular delivery of RNA and other oligonucleotides entrapped in endosomes, develop methods for their efficient cellular delivery, and demonstrate applicability by targeting skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. The center will use sophisticated microscopes to measure oligonucleotide-membrane interaction in vitro and in live cells, AI tools to analyse the data and design and synthesize better DNA and RNA pharmaceutics that escape endosomes.`,
